This is my project that repreesents a list of posts.
The posts can be monitored if selected in their checkbox.

to run the application clone the repository to a destined folder,

Get inside the folder by writing in the terminal "cd .\Posts-List".

Then write "npm install".
and then write "npm run dev" to run the application.

Enjoy :)
